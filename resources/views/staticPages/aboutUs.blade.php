        <h3>What is Date Assured?</h3>

        <p>The original concept of speed dating was invented in the late nineties in the USA. You may have heard about speed dating events in your city, where you purchase tickets to attend a speed dating event at a restaurant, lunge bar or other special location set up by a dedicated speed dating company.&nbsp; With COVID-19 and never ending lockdowns it has become impossible to attend traditional speed dating events. At Date Assured, we have taken this original concept and recreated it in an online format. Same concept, same purpose but with a convenience to attend speed dating events from the comfort of your home. &nbsp;</p>


        <h3>How it works?</h3>

        <p>We've made the whole process very simple and convenient.</p>

        <p>First, you need to register and set up your profile. Upload a nice looking picture of yourself so your future matches can see and remember you.</p>

        <p>To participate in an online speed dating session you will need to select your city, dating interest, and your age group from the list. Select a prefered time and search for available sessions. All upcoming sessions will be shown on the list indicating a number of available spots. All sessions have a maximum capacity of 5 pairs, that is 5 males and 5 females, and 5 rounds of video chats. In each round you will have 3 minutes to video chat with your partner, and the next partner will connect to you automatically in the following round.</p>


        <h3>Your matches and potential real dates (not available in BETA)</h3>

        <p>If you like the person you've just had the video conversation with, you can click LIKE on them and if they do the same, you will be matched! This will add you both to each other's friends list where you will be able to communicate at any time via our inbuilt messenger and see each other's profile information.</p>

        <p>All your matches are potential real dates, how you impress them is up to you.</p>

        <p>We continue to work on our speed dating platform and this feature will be added very soon.</p>
